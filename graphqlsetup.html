                        <p>Amidst this pandemic, we all have read many articles stating the carbon emission has lowered
                            by 17 percent, seen photos of clear waters in Venice canal, clear Delhi skies. Many animals
                            returned to their indigenous habitats where humans took over. But recently National
                            Geographic has published an article where it has stated that these changes will be temporary
                            but rather after this pandemic is over we will see an increased amount of pollution levels.
                            And this might be true, as a recent study shows that the carbon emissions are only 5 percent
                            lower than at the same point in 2019, even though normal activity has not yet fully
                            restarted. Why is this so? “We still have the same cars, the same roads, the same
                            industries, same houses,” says Corinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change at the
                            University of East Anglia in Britain and lead author of the original study and subsequent
                            update. “So as soon as the restrictions are released, we go right back to where we were.”
                            All the healing done by the environment during this pandemic is temporary, and if we have to
                            make it permanent we will have to make changes in our lives because change starts from us.
